  What is this?
</DT><DD>
  It's a prototype of a game (engine) I'm writing on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
  The code is open-sourced at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/weihwa-puzzles/">http://code.google.com/p/weihwa-puzzles/</a>, along with a lot of
  other code that drives my puzzle site.

  I didn't mean to login as test@example.com (or whatever), can I log out?
</DT><DD>
  <form action="/puzzlelogout?url=/">
  Yes: <input type=submit value="Click here to log out">
  </form>
</DD><DT>
  Guessing a random number is hardly a "deduction game."
</DT><DD>
  It's a placeholder game while I work on the real game.

  Your UI is crappy.  Shouldn't you be using <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>?
</DT><DD>
  I'm focusing on server-side features.  If you want to help me with UI (or, for that matter, anything else), I'm happy to
  accept collaborators.

  I have more questions!
